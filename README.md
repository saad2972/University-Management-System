# 🎓 University Management System

This **University Management System** is a desktop-based Java application that showcases core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles through real-world scenarios in an academic environment. The project is developed using **Java Swing** to provide a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** that is clean, interactive, and user-friendly.

### 🔧 Features:
- Add, update, and view student and teacher records
- Manage student fees and leave requests
- Teacher leave and attendance handling
- Examination and marks entry modules
- Login system with splash screen
- Central dashboard for navigation

### 🧠 OOP Concepts Demonstrated:
This project applies Java **OOP concepts** including:
- **Encapsulation** (e.g., student and teacher data classes)
- **Inheritance** (shared base functionalities)
- **Abstraction** (structured class designs)
- **Polymorphism** (method overloading and overriding)

The file structure includes well-defined classes such as `StudentDetails.java`, `AddTeacher.java`, `EnterMarks.java`, and more — each with clear responsibilities and behaviors.

### 🖥 GUI Design:
The user interface is built using **Java Swing**, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience. All modules are presented through intuitive windows and dialogs, making the system accessible and easy to use for administrators.

### 💾 Database Connectivity:
> **Note:** The system is designed to connect with a **MySQL** database using JDBC. Although a database server is not included in this repository, the necessary Java code (see files like `Conn.java`) is already written to support **MySQL integration**.

📌 **If you wish to use the system with a database**:
- Set up a MySQL server
- Create the required schema and tables
- Update your database credentials in the `Conn.java` file
- Run the application and enjoy full database functionality

### 📝 Final Note:
This project demonstrates not only my skills in Java and GUI application development but also the practical use of **OOP in designing scalable, real-world systems**. Whether you're reviewing it for learning or integrating it with your own backend setup, the codebase is organized and ready to adapt.
